## Using the Flashcards App

This app closely resembles and earlier version of Quizlet for those who are familiar with it. However, for those who aren't this application is most useful for studying a deck of flash cards. These decks and cards are completely customizable with text. A few routes here will allow you to study a deck of cards and edit/create a card/deck. For now, no additional edits are scheduled to be made.
